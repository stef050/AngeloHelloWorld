# How to use this repo

This README.md file is currently in the master branch. Once you have cloned the repo, you should immediately create a branch
so that you can work. Before merging your code into master it must be tested or reviewed. Think of the situation where 20 devs are working off the same repo, if one person breaks the code it is broken for everyone. That is why we have these processes along with others to always protect a master branch. You will later learn about things like CI if we get to it.

To clone a repo, after installing GIT on your machine (google will help you there), use command:

`git clone https://github.com/stef050/AngeloHelloWorld.git`

The above url can be taken from the home page of the repo.

To create a branch:

`git checkout -b <branch name>`

Branch names should be of format:
<Trello Ticket Number>_<Description-Of-Task>
